## Functionality
The Crush Forex Trading Robot utilizes the MetaTrader MQL5 programming language and includes the necessary libraries for trade execution and technical analysis indicators. It implements a specific trading logic based on the Product Crush strategy.

The code defines global variables for risk management, including the percentage of account balance to risk per trade, stop loss and take profit percentages, and maximum allowable spread. It also initializes the necessary trade object and technical indicators.

The main trading logic is implemented in the `TradeLogic` function. It checks if the current CCI (Commodity Channel Index) value crosses above 0 and if the price is above a moving average. If these conditions are met, a trade is executed using the `ExecuteTrade` function, calculating the lot size based on the risk percentage and stop loss value.

The `OnInit` function is used for initialization, setting up the technical indicators and subscribing to the necessary symbols and timeframes. The `OnTick` function is called on every tick and executes the trading logic. The `OnDeinit` function is used for cleaning up resources. Finally, the `OnStart` function executes the trading logic once at the start.
